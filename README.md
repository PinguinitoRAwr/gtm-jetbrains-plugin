# JetBrains Git Time Metrics (GTM) plug-in
#### IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, AppCode, RubyMine, PhpStorm, AndroidStudio Plug-ins 
### Simple, seamless, lightweight time tracking for all your git projects

Git Time Metrics (GTM) is a tool to automatically track time spent reading and working on code that you store in a Git repository. By installing GTM and using supported plug-ins for your favorite editors, you can immediately realize better insight into how you are spending your time and on what files.

# Installation

Installing GTM is a two step process.  First, it's recommended you install the GTM executable that the plug-in integrates with and then install the JetBrains GTM plug-in.  Please submit an issue if you have any problems and/or questions.

1. Follow the [Getting Started](https://github.com/git-time-metric/gtm/blob/master/README.md) section to install the GTM executable for your operating system.
2. Install the plug-in from your JetBrains IDE, select `Preferences` -> `Plugins` -> `Browse Repositories...` and search for `Git Time Metric`. 

**Note** - to enable time tracking for a Git repository, you need to initialize it with `gtm init` otherwise it will be ignored by GTM. This is done via the command line. You can run this within the JetBrains IDE terminal.
```
> cd /path/to/your/project
> gtm init
```

Consult the [README](https://github.com/git-time-metric/gtm/blob/master/README.md) and [Wiki](https://github.com/git-time-metric/gtm/wiki) for more information.

# Features

### Status Bar

In the status bar see your total time spent for in-process work (uncommitted).

**Note** - the time shown is based on the file's path and the Git repository it belongs to. You can have several files open that belong to different Git repositories. The status bar will display the time for the current file's Git repository.  Also keep in mind, a Git repository must be initialized for time tracking in order to track time.

### Command Line Interface

Use the command line to report on time logged for your commits.

Here are some examples of insights GTM can provide you.
